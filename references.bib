abstract = {Forest ecosystems worldwide currently face worrying episodes of forest decline, which have boosted weakening and mortality of the trees. In the Mediterranean region, especially in the southeast Iberian Peninsula, Pinus sylvestris forests are severely affected by this phenomenon, and it has been commonly attributed to drought events. Remarkably, the role of root microbiota on pine decline has been overlooked and remains unclear. We therefore used metabarcoding to identify the belowground microbial communities of decline-affected and unaffected pine trees. Taxonomic composition of bacterial and fungal rhizosphere communities, and fungal populations dwelling in root endosphere showed different profiles depending on the health status of the trees. The root endosphere of asymptomatic trees was as strongly dominated by ‘Candidatus Phytoplasma pini’ as the root of decline-affected pines, accounting for >99 % of the total bacterial sequences in some samples. Notwithstanding, the titer of this phytopathogen was four-fold higher in symptomatic trees than in symptomless ones. Furthermore, the microbiota inhabiting the root endosphere of decline-affected trees assembled into a less complex and more modularized network. Thus, the observed changes in the microbial communities could be a cause or a consequence of forest decline phenomenon. Moreover, ‘Ca. Phytoplasma pini’ is positively correlated to Pinus sylvestris decline events, either as the primary cause of pine decline or as an opportunistic pathogen exacerbating the process once the tree has been weaken by other factors.}
